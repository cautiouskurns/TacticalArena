## Technical Deep Dives

### Material System Architecture
```csharp
// Material cache structure for performance optimization
private Dictionary<string, Material> materialCache;
private Dictionary<ObstacleType, Material> obstacleMaterials;
private Dictionary<GridTileState, Material> tileMaterials;

// Dynamic material application with event notifications
public void UpdateMaterialColor(string materialName, Color newColor)
{
    Material material = GetMaterial(materialName);
    if (material != null)
    {
        material.color = newColor;
        OnMaterialColorChanged?.Invoke(material, newColor);
    }
}
```

**Learning Point**: Dictionary-based caching provides O(1) material lookups while event notifications enable reactive UI updates.

### Visual Feedback Performance Optimization
```csharp
// Object pooling for visual effects
private Queue<GameObject> effectObjectPool;
private int maxConcurrentEffects = 16;

// Performance-conscious animation limiting
if (activeEffectCount >= maxConcurrentEffects) return;
```

**Learning Point**: Object pooling combined with effect limits prevents performance degradation while maintaining rich visual feedback.

### Performance Monitoring Implementation
```csharp
// Real-time performance tracking
private Queue<float> frameTimeHistory;
private Queue<float> frameRateHistory;

// Dynamic quality adjustment based on performance
if (averageFrameRate < qualityAdjustmentThreshold && qualityLevel > 0)
{
    qualityLevel--;
    ApplyQualityLevel(qualityLevel);
}
```

**Learning Point**: Historical performance data enables intelligent quality adjustments that maintain target frame rates.
