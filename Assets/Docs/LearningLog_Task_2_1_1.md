## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

#### Interface-Based Combat System
- **IAttacker Interface**: Defines attack capabilities, validation, and properties
- **IAttackable Interface**: Defines damage reception, health management, and target validation
- **Component Separation**: AttackCapability and TargetCapability as separate, composable components
- **Event-Driven Coordination**: Comprehensive event system for loose coupling between systems

#### Multi-Stage Validation Pipeline
```
Attack Request → State Validation → Team Validation → Position Validation → Line-of-Sight Validation → Execute Attack
```

#### Combat Manager Architecture
- **Centralized Coordination**: Single point for all attack requests and validation
- **Turn Management**: Configurable attacks per turn with state tracking
- **Registration System**: Automatic attacker/attackable discovery and management
- **Event Broadcasting**: System-wide notifications for combat state changes

### Key Technical Insights

#### 1. Interface Design for Tactical Combat
**Challenge**: Creating flexible combat interfaces that support diverse unit types while maintaining tactical gameplay rules.

**Solution**: Separate IAttacker and IAttackable interfaces with comprehensive validation contracts:
```csharp
public interface IAttacker
{
    AttackValidationResult ValidateAttack(IAttackable target);
    void OnAttackPerformed(IAttackable target, int damage);
    void OnAttackFailed(IAttackable target, string reason);
}

public interface IAttackable  
{
    int TakeDamage(int damage, IAttacker attacker);
    TargetValidationResult ValidateAsTarget(IAttacker attacker);
    void OnDeath(IAttacker killer);
}
```

**Learning**: Interface segregation with validation contracts provides flexibility while enforcing tactical rules.

#### 2. Multi-Stage Attack Validation
**Challenge**: Ensuring attacks follow tactical rules including team restrictions, range limits, and line-of-sight requirements.

**Solution**: Comprehensive validation pipeline with detailed failure reporting:
- **State Validation**: Attacker ability, cooldowns, and turn limits
- **Team Validation**: Prevent friendly fire with team-based restrictions  
- **Position Validation**: Range checking with grid-based distance calculations
- **Line-of-Sight Validation**: Integration with obstacle system for tactical positioning

**Learning**: Staged validation with clear failure reasons improves debugging and provides foundation for AI decision-making.

#### 3. Combat Input Integration
**Challenge**: Seamlessly integrating combat input with existing selection and movement systems without disrupting established workflows.

**Solution**: CombatInputHandler with multiple input modes:
- **Click-to-Attack**: Direct target clicking for immediate attacks
- **Attack Mode Toggle**: Key-activated mode with visual feedback
- **Double-Click Attack**: Alternative input method for different player preferences
- **Right-Click Attack**: Context-sensitive combat input

**Learning**: Multiple input modes with automatic mode detection based on selection state provides intuitive combat interaction.

#### 4. Visual Targeting System
**Challenge**: Providing clear visual feedback for attack ranges, valid targets, and tactical decision-making.

**Solution**: TargetingSystem with comprehensive visual feedback:
- **Range Indicators**: Dynamic range visualization with transparent materials
- **Target Highlighting**: Color-coded valid/invalid target distinction
- **Pulsing Effects**: Animated feedback for active targeting mode
- **Hover Preview**: Real-time target validation feedback

**Learning**: Visual feedback systems require careful material management and performance optimization for smooth tactical gameplay.

### System Integration Challenges

#### 1. Component Registration and Discovery
**Challenge**: Automatically discovering and registering combat-capable units without manual configuration.

**Solution**: Automatic registration through component lifecycle:
```csharp
void Start()
{
    combatManager = FindFirstObjectByType<CombatManager>();
    if (combatManager != null)
    {
        combatManager.RegisterAttacker(this);
    }
}
```

**Learning**: Automatic registration with graceful fallbacks provides robust system integration without configuration overhead.

#### 2. Event System Coordination
**Challenge**: Coordinating combat events across multiple systems (selection, movement, visual feedback, health management) without tight coupling.

**Solution**: Hierarchical event system with selective subscription:
- **Combat-specific events**: OnAttackPerformed, OnAttackFailed, OnTargetDeath
- **System integration events**: OnCombatModeActivated, OnTargetingStarted
- **UI feedback events**: OnDamageReceived, OnHealthChanged

**Learning**: Event hierarchies with selective subscription allow systems to respond to relevant state changes without system-wide broadcasting overhead.

2. **Interface Implementation**: Automatic component attachment with configuration
3. **System Integration**: Input handler integration with existing SelectionManager
4. **Validation and Testing**: Comprehensive system verification with error reporting

**Learning**: Complex system setup requires careful ordering and dependency management with comprehensive validation at each stage.

#### 2. Material Integration with URP
**Challenge**: Creating combat materials that integrate seamlessly with Universal Render Pipeline and existing material systems.

**Solution**: Programmatic material creation with URP-specific shader configuration:
```csharp
Material CreateCombatMaterial(string name, Color baseColor, bool transparent = false)
{
    Material material = new Material(Shader.Find("Universal Render Pipeline/Lit"));
    material.name = name;
    
    if (transparent)
    {
        material.SetFloat("_Surface", 1); // Transparent
        material.SetFloat("_Blend", 0); // Alpha blend
        material.renderQueue = 3000;
    }
    
    material.color = baseColor;
    return material;
}
```

**Learning**: Programmatic material creation with shader-specific configuration provides consistent visual integration while supporting editor customization.
